# basic-billing-system
A billing system is a program or process that handles customer transactions by recording orders, calculating costs, and generating the final bill.

In your program’s context (restaurant billing system), the billing process works like this:

Customer Identification

The system takes the customer’s name to personalize the experience.

Menu Display

The available items and their prices are shown so the customer can choose.

Order Placement

The customer selects a dish from the menu by entering the item number.

The system asks for the number of quantities they want.

Bill Calculation

Based on the chosen item and quantity, the system calculates the total cost.

Example: If a Dal fry costs ₹40 and quantity is 2, the cost = 40 × 2 = 80.

Bill Display

The system informs the customer of the total amount to be paid for their order.

Order Confirmation

After showing the bill, the system confirms that the order has been placed.

In a real-world system, this would also update records, inventory, or send the order to the kitchen.

✅ In short:
Your billing system automates the process of taking orders, calculating the bill, and confirming the order, making the restaurant workflow easier and more efficient.
